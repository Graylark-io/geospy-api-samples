# GeoSpy AI API Sample

This repository contains sample code for interacting with the GeoSpy AI API developed by Graylark Technologies LLC. GeoSpy is a cutting-edge geolocation inference API that utilizes pixel data and AI/ML techniques to infer the geographical location of a photo with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Geolocation Inference**: Determine the likely geographical location of a photo using only its pixel data.
- **Image Classification**: (Beta) Classify images into predefined categories alongside geolocation inference.
- **Clustering Support**: Predict multiple geolocations for a single image if predictions are to close to each other.

## Getting Started
In order to use the GeoSpy AI API, you will need to obtain an API key from Graylark Technologies LLC. Once you have an API key, you can use the sample code in this repository to interact with the API. Make sure to install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed the required packages, you can use the sample code to interact with the GeoSpy AI API. The examples folder contains sample code for using the API to infer the geolocation of a photo. We have included a jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use the API to infer the geolocation of a photo. 

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.9 or later installed on your system. You will also need `pip` for installing Python packages.
